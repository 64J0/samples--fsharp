** About F#

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
F# is a universal programming language for writing succinct, robust and
performant code.

F# allows you to write uncluttered, self-documenting code, where your focus
remains on your problem domain, rather than the details of programming.

It does this without compromising on speed and compatibility - it is
open-source, cross-platform and interoperable.
